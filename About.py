# About :) 

Welcome to DS105SuperStars steam's API project! \n
We are a group of 3 students from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). 

## Our Team

## Our Project

Our aim is to study what makes a game successful on steam. We will be using the steam API to gather data on games and their reviews.\n
We will then use this data to create a dashboard that will allow us to explore the data and answer our research questions.
